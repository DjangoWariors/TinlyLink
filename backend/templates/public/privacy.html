                <h3 class="text-lg font-medium text-secondary-light mt-5 mb-2">1.1 Account Information</h3>
                <p>When you create an account, we collect:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 space-y-1">
                    <li><strong>Email address</strong> — used for login, notifications, and account recovery.</li>
                    <li><strong>Name</strong> — displayed in your profile and team workspaces.</li>
                    <li><strong>Password</strong> — stored as a one-way hash (Argon2). We never store or see your plain-text password.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="mt-3">
                    If you sign in with Google OAuth, we receive your name and email from Google. We do not access your
                    Google contacts, calendar, or other account data.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-lg font-medium text-secondary-light mt-5 mb-2">1.2 Link and QR Code Data</h3>
                <p>When you use the Service, we store:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 space-y-1">
                    <li>Original (destination) URLs you shorten.</li>
                    <li>Short link slugs, tags, and metadata you assign.</li>
                    <li>QR code configuration (colors, style, logo, content).</li>
                    <li>Campaign and UTM parameters you attach to links.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="text-lg font-medium text-secondary-light mt-5 mb-2">1.3 Click Analytics Data</h3>
                <p>
                    When someone clicks a shortened link or scans a QR code, we collect anonymized analytics data:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 space-y-1">
                    <li><strong>IP address</strong> — used to determine approximate geographic location (country and city level), then discarded. We do not store raw IP addresses long-term.</li>
                    <li><strong>User agent</strong> — parsed to determine device type, operating system, and browser. The raw user agent string is not retained.</li>
                    <li><strong>Referrer URL</strong> — the page that linked to your short URL.</li>
                    <li><strong>Timestamp</strong> — when the click occurred.</li>
                    <li><strong>UTM parameters</strong> — if present in the link, these are captured for campaign attribution.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="mt-3">
                    This data is associated with your links, not with the individuals who click them. We do not build
                    profiles of link visitors or track them across different links.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-lg font-medium text-secondary-light mt-5 mb-2">1.4 Payment Information</h3>
                <p>
                    If you subscribe to a paid plan, payment is processed by Stripe. We do not store your full credit card
                    number. We receive and store only:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 space-y-1">
                    <li>Last four digits of your card (for display in your billing settings).</li>
                    <li>Card brand and expiration date.</li>
                    <li>Stripe customer and subscription identifiers.</li>
                    <li>Invoice and payment history.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="text-lg font-medium text-secondary-light mt-5 mb-2">1.5 Technical and Usage Data</h3>
                <p>We automatically collect certain information when you use the dashboard:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 space-y-1">
                    <li>Browser type and version.</li>
                    <li>Device type and operating system.</li>
                    <li>Pages visited within the Service.</li>
                    <li>Session duration and interaction patterns.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="mt-3">
                    This helps us understand how the Service is used and identify areas for improvement.

                <h3 class="text-lg font-medium text-secondary-light mt-5 mb-2">3.4 Business Transfers</h3>
                <p>

                    TinlyLink is a link management platform — by its nature, it redirects users to third-party websites.
                    We are not responsible for the privacy practices of destination websites. Each shortened link leads
                    to a URL chosen by the link creator, not by TinlyLink.
