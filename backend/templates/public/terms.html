                </ul>
                <p class="mt-3">
                    We reserve the right to disable any link, QR code, or account that violates these rules, with or without prior notice.

                <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-secondary mb-3">3. Plans and Billing</h2>
                <p>TinlyLink offers free and paid subscription plans. For paid plans:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-3 space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>Billing cycle.</strong> Subscriptions are billed monthly. Your card is charged at the start of each billing period.</li>
                    <li><strong>Plan changes.</strong> You can upgrade or downgrade at any time. Upgrades take effect immediately; downgrades take effect at the end of the current billing period.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cancellation.</strong> You can cancel your subscription at any time from your account settings. You'll retain access to paid features until the end of your current billing period. After that, your account reverts to the free plan.</li>
                    <li><strong>Refunds.</strong> We do not offer refunds for partial billing periods. If you believe you were charged in error, contact us and we'll review the situation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Price changes.</strong> We may adjust pricing with at least 30 days' notice. Continued use after a price change constitutes acceptance of the new pricing.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="mt-3">
                    Payment processing is handled by Stripe. By subscribing, you also agree to

            <div>
                <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-secondary mb-3">4. Link and QR Code Ownership</h2>
                <p>
                    You retain ownership of the original URLs you shorten and any content behind them. TinlyLink does not
                    claim ownership over your links, QR codes, or destination content.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-3">
                    However, by using the Service, you grant TinlyLink a limited license to process, redirect, and cache
                    your URLs as necessary to operate the Service. This includes storing metadata (such as click counts,
                    geographic data, and referrer information) associated with your links.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-3">
                    Short links created on our default domain (tinlylink.com) use slugs assigned by our system. While we
                    make reasonable efforts to keep your links active, we do not guarantee permanent availability of any
                    specific short URL slug on our shared domain.

            <div>
                <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-secondary mb-3">5. Custom Domains</h2>
                <p>Paid plans may include the ability to use your own custom domain for short links. When using custom domains:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-3 space-y-2">
                    <li>You must own or have authorization to use the domain you register.</li>
                    <li>You are responsible for DNS configuration and domain renewal.</li>
                    <li>If your subscription lapses, links on your custom domain will stop resolving through TinlyLink.</li>
                    <li>We may verify domain ownership via DNS TXT records.</li>
                </ul>

            <div>
                <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-secondary mb-3">6. API Usage</h2>
                <p>
                    TinlyLink provides a REST API for programmatic access. API usage is subject to the rate limits and
                    quotas defined by your plan. You agree to:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-3 space-y-2">
                    <li>Keep your API keys confidential. Do not embed them in client-side code or public repositories.</li>
                    <li>Respect rate limits. Exceeding your plan's limits may result in temporary throttling or suspension of API access.</li>
                    <li>Not use the API to build a competing URL shortening service.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <!-- 7. Analytics and Data -->
            <div>
                <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-secondary mb-3">7. Analytics and Data</h2>
                <p>
                    TinlyLink collects anonymous click analytics when someone visits a shortened link. This includes
                    information such as geographic location (country/city level), device type, browser, operating system,
                    and referrer. This data is aggregated and made available to you through your dashboard.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-3">
                    Analytics data retention depends on your plan. Free plan data is retained for 30 days, Pro for 1 year,
                    and Business plan data is retained indefinitely. When data passes its retention period, it is permanently deleted.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We strive to keep TinlyLink available and reliable, but we do not guarantee uninterrupted service.
                    The Service may be temporarily unavailable due to maintenance, updates, or circumstances beyond our control.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-3">
                    We are not liable for any losses resulting from service downtime, including missed clicks or
                    temporarily inaccessible links.

                <p>
                    You may close your account at any time through your account settings. Upon closure, your links will
                    stop redirecting, your QR codes will become inactive, and your analytics data will be deleted.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-3">
                    We may suspend or terminate your account if you violate these Terms. In cases of serious abuse
                    (malware, phishing, spam), we may terminate your account immediately without notice.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-3">
                    You can export your data before closing your account. We provide data export functionality in your
